ImgClean.io is a simple webtool that strips all metadata from an picture, so itâ€™s safe to share on social media. The stripping of the metadata happens client-side, therefore the photo is never uploaded to a server.

## Removing metadata from your photos

Modern cameras store much more information in your pictures than just that wonderful sunset or that twinkle in your girlfriend's eyes. This extra information is called metadata and contains things like the location where the photo is taken or the brand of camera.

Metadata can tell a lot more about you than you think, that's why it is a good idea to remove the metadata before you upload a photo to social media for example.
